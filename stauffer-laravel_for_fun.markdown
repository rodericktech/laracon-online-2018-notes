Laravel For Fun (and profit?)
-----------------------------

### Introduction

Story 1 - **Science for Grandma?** Matt introduces his son's 5-minute science podcast.
100% DIY, minimum viable tech to make it happen.

It works!  But none of the intended audience knows how to subscribe to a
podcast.  He wanted to meet them where they were, instead of forcing them to
'update' their tech savvy.

Story 2 - **Book Promo**, etc.

None of these things would be possible without Laravel.  But isn't Laravel
'for fun and profit'?  (None of the stories were profitable)

### The Theory

"How do I take the apps that I have built and monetize them?"  It turns out
that he doesn't care.  He sees a need and builds the quickest-dirtiest
solutions possible, and then leaves them alone.  Some of the apps never
get finished.

Why did I start coding?  (hint: not to make money)

What if there are other reasons to write code?

_Just because it doesn't make you rich and famous, it doesn't make it
not worth doing._

There are a lot of common reasons to build apps, and they don't all have
to do with making money or becoming known.  Many other reasons have to do with
_human flourishing_.

### How Do We Evaluate Tools?

How do we respond to the flood of new tools out there?  (chatbot story)

There are a lot of reasons to consider them besides work / profit.

### Speed Matters

"The faster I can build things (Laravel), the more things I can justify building."

### Story Time Part 2 - How I Built Science for Grandma

- SimpleCast
- Publish on Apple Podcasts
- Announce on Facebook
- LAMBO
- Build signup views
- Create users
- RSS -> notifications (multi-channel) laravel-notification-channels.com
- Hook in to Twilio
- Hook in to Facebook (Socialite)
    - Needs interactivity, custom solution didn't work
    - Enter Botman
- Flash lights outside house XD (Zttp::post)

We often underestimate the way programming can reach people for the better
through now-ubiquitous platforms.  [Little stories that illustrate, IoT]

_The possibilities are endless._

### What change can I make today?

- Change your perspective on what's worth building.
- Change your perspective on what is worth using.
- Change your perspective on what you're capable of.
- Work for human flourishing... and fun.

Recognize the power we have to change other people's lives.

**I can do that! I'm a programmer!**
